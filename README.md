# SCOPTIONS-September-2019
Some code we'll walk through during the SCOPTIONS meeting.  There is nothing you have to do, this is just for reference.

Right now the ipynb file is just a placeholder, I'll put a more finalized version up before the meeting in case you want to follow along.

If we make changes I'll post them here after the class as well.

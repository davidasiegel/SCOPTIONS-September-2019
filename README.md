# SCOPTIONS-September-2019
The file "SCOPTIONS Class.ipynb" will have some code we'll walk through during the SCOPTIONS meeting (no experience necessary).  There is nothing you have to do, I'm just posting this for reference.

Right now the ipynb file is just a placeholder, I'll put a more finalized version up before the meeting in case you want to follow along.

If we make changes I'll post them here after the class as well.

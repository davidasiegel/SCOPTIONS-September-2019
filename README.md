# SCOPTIONS-September-2019
The file "SCOPTIONS Class.ipynb" has some code we'll walk through during the SCOPTIONS meeting (no experience necessary).  There is nothing you have to do, I'm just posting this for reference.

If we make changes I'll post them here after the meeting as well.

If the notebook doesn't render for you in github (github is having problems), this should work: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/davidasiegel/SCOPTIONS-September-2019/blob/master/SCOPTIONS%20Class.ipynb 

Here's the recording of the talk I gave (feel free to adjust the playback speed with the gear icon...): https://www.dropbox.com/s/65e5y2gsfdhevou/20190925_SCOPTIONS.mp4?dl=0
